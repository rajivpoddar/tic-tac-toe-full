# Architectural Design for Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Component Structure
- App: The main component that renders the game board and other UI elements.
- GameBoard: A component that displays the 3x3 grid and handles the game logic.
- GridCell: A component for each cell in the game board.
- ScoreBoard: A component to display the players' scores.
- PlayerScore: A component to display the score for each player.
- ControlButtons: A component to render the 'Previous Step' and 'Reset Board' buttons.

## State Management
- The App component will maintain the state of the game, including the current board state, player turns, and scores.
- State will be managed using React's useState hook to ensure unidirectional data flow.
- The GameBoard component will receive the board state and player turn as props and will notify the App component of any changes via callback functions.
- The ScoreBoard component will receive the players' scores as props.

## Data Flow
- Data will flow from the App component down to its children.
- Callback functions will be used to communicate events (like a player's move) back up to the App component.

This design will be the foundation for implementing the Tic-Tac-Toe game following the Test-Driven Development methodology.
